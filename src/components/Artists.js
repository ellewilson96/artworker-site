          <h1>Our Artists</h1>
          <p>Artists have been called the “foot soldiers of gentrification” because they are often the first tenants of derelict buildings in run down areas. Attracted by cheap spaces for their studios and workshops, they popularized loft style living and the Bohemian neighborhoods which have become so popular with developers and the moneyed class. As a consequence, it is estimated that 70% of NYC artist studio space has been lost to gentrification in the last 20 years and many artists leave the city due to lack of cheap studio space.</p>
          <p>Artists such as Rothko, Warhol and Basquiat would now struggle to find the kind of affordable spaces they worked in during the 60’s, 70,s and 80’s
          </p>
          <p>ArtWorker aims to reverse that trend, not just with much needed free studio space, but actually financially rewarding them for the positive contribution they make to what would otherwise be a bland concrete jungle.
