            <p>ArtWorker is an inspirational creative program which each employee can benefit from on their own terms and at any time.
            </p>
            <p>Art is an important factor in overall wellness, encouraging conversation, boosting cognitive problem solving and increases productivity. There are many proven benefits (and just common sense) why you already hang art in your workspace and adding an actual artist, takes those obvious benefits and increases them many fold.
            </p>
            <p>Employers can use the fact that they are genuinely supporting artists and their staff by including the program in their social media and marketing campaigns, improving your corporate repuation and creating a more creative work environment which helps attract and retain employees.

            <p>It is estimated that 70% of NYC artist studio space has been lost to gentrification in the last 20 years and many artists leave the city due to lack of cheap studio space. Artists such as Rothko, Warhol and Basquait would now struggle to find the kind of affordable spaces they worked in. ArtWorker aims to reverse that trend, not just with much needed free studio space, but by also financially supporting them.
