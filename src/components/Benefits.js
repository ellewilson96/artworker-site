              <h2>Artists</h2>
              <p>Artists have been called the “foot soldiers of gentrification” because they are often the first tenants of derelict buildings in run down areas. Attracted by cheap spaces for their studios and workshops, they popularized loft style living and the Bohemian neighborhoods which have become so popular with developers and the moneyed class. As a consequence, it is estimated that 70% of NYC artist studio space has been lost to gentrification in the last 20 years and many artists leave the city due to lack of cheap studio space.
               Artists such as Rothko, Warhol and Basquait would now struggle to find the kind of affordable spaces they worked in during the 60’s, 70,s and 80’s
              ArtWorker aims to reverse that trend, not just with much needed free studio space, but actually financially rewarding them for the positive contribution they make to what would otherwise be a bland concrete jungle.

              <h2>Employees</h2>
              <p>From children on the spectrum, to disaffected teens, to bored adults or seniors recovering from cancer treatment, there are hundreds of studies which show the mental and physical health benefits of art. We all remember the feeling of pleasure and pride as children when we drew something that was then stuck to the fridge door. From painting on caves to posting on Instagram, humans have always loved visually expressing the world they see around them.
              Art not only releases and decreases stress but is an important factor in overall wellness. Art is something which encourages conversation, boosts cognitive problem solving and increases productivity. There are many proven benefits (and just common sense) why you incorporated art into your workspace. Adding an artist, takes those obvious benefits and increases them many fold.

              <h2>Employers</h2>
              <p>Two of the hardest aspects of modern life are digital isolation and stress. Employers have long since realized that team building and stress reduction lead to a happier, more productive working environment. Wellness initiatives, motivational support and personal growth have become an important part of corporate responsibility because they show an employer genuinely cares for their staff. In return, employees are more loyal and productive.
              ArtWorker is a non judgemental, inspirational and therapeutic program which each employee can benefit from on their own terms and at any time for less than they spend on a cup of coffee.
              Employers can use the fact that they are genuinely supporting artists and their staff by including the program in their social media and marketing campaigns. The participating artists love to have themselves and their art promoted so will provide you with a wealth of visually interesting marketing collateral.
              Your company may be inspired to purchase the work created by the artists in residence on your premises, using tax incentives to begin your own corporate art acquisition program.
