            From children on the spectrum, to disaffected teens, to bored adults or seniors recovering from cancer treatment, there are hundreds of studies which show the mental and physical health benefits of art. We all remember the feeling of pleasure and pride as children when we drew something that was then stuck to the fridge door. From cavepaintings to Augmented Reality, humans have always loved visually expressing the world they see around them.
            Art not only releases and decreases stress but is an important factor in overall wellness. Art is something which encourages conversation, boosts cognitive problem solving and increases productivity. There are many proven benefits (and just common sense) why you incorporated art into your workspace. Adding an artist, takes those obvious benefits and increases them many fold.
