              Two of the hardest aspects of modern life are digital isolation and stress. Employers have long since realized that team building and stress reduction lead to a happier, more productive working environment. Wellness initiatives, motivational support and personal growth have become an important part of corporate responsibility because they show an employer genuinely cares for their staff. In return, employees are more loyal and productive.
              ArtWorker is a non judgemental, inspirational and therapeutic program which each employee can benefit from on their own terms and at any time for less than they spend on a cup of coffee.
              Employers can use the fact that they are genuinely supporting artists and their staff by including the program in their social media and marketing campaigns. The participating artists love to have themselves and their art promoted so will provide you with a wealth of visually interesting marketing collateral.
              Your company may be inspired to purchase the work created by the artists in residence on your premises, using tax incentives to begin your won corporate art acquisition program.
