            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>We have a variety of fully vetted, insured, professional artists to suit your space and taste.
            </p>
            <p>Clients commit to a one month placement and each artist arrives with an ArtWorker portable studio which takes up just 8x8ft of self contained floor space. No stains, no noise, no paint smells.
            </p>
            <p>Artists give a personal and written introduction to employees where they describe their work and outline the art they plan to create during their residency.
            </p>
            <p>During the residency, your employees are encouraged to interact with the artist, from simple conversation, to attending their artist in conversation and learning workshop program.
            </p>
            <p>Depending on available wall space, the artist will hang artwork in your space and towards the end of each residency, there is a gallery opening style social event where the artist will also display the work they created and discuss the residencyâ€™s positive experiences.
            </p>
