                </p>
                <p>Clients commit to a one month placement and each artist arrives with an ArtWorker portable studio which takes up just 6x8ft of self contained floor space.
                No stains, no noise, no spraypaint smells.</p>
                <p>Artists give a personal and written introduction to employees where they describe their work and outline the art they plan to create during their residency.</p>
                <p>During the residency, our employees are encouraged to interact with the artist, from simple conversation, to attending their artist in conversation and learning workshop program.
                Depending on available wall space, the artist will hang artwork in your space and towards the end of each residency, there is a gallery opening style social event where the artist will also display the work they created and discuss the residencyâ€™s positive experiences.
