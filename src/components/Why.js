          <p>Life can be incrdibly stressful and art is proven to lower stress, increase wellness,
          and boost both innovation and interpersonal connections. The popularity of Instagram shows
          the insatiable appetite for visual creativity.</p>
          <p>Artists have always relied on patronage to support and further their creative careers.
          From the pope commissioning Michelangelo to brands sponsoring street murals, each of these
          relationships benefits both parties.</p>
          <p>As gentrification has reduced the amount of cheap studio space, emerging artists
          are being squeezed out of every city.</p>
